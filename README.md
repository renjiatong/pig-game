# Welcome to Pig Game

Pig Game is a simple, web-based dice game that you can play with friends or by yourself. The goal of the game is to accumulate the highest score without rolling a 1.

# How to Play
To begin, click the "Roll" button to roll the die. If you roll a 1, your turn is over and you lose all the points you accumulated during your turn. If you roll any other number, that number is added to your turn total.

You can choose to "Hold" at any time during your turn to end your turn and add your turn total to your overall score. If you choose to roll again, be careful as rolling a 1 will cause you to lose your accumulated points.

You can also set the target score to play to, if you wish to play a shorter or longer game.

The game will automatically detect when a player reaches the target score and declare them the winner.

# Have fun!
Pig Game is a fun and simple way to pass the time with friends or by yourself. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed creating it.
